title: Install NTP on CentOS
---


# Install NTP and its documentation.

```sh
yum install ntp ntp-doc
```

# Configure NTP servers to query from.

Head to http://www.pool.ntp.org/en/ and select the country based on the geographical location of the server. For example, the following servers would be used for a server located in the U.S.:

```
server 0.us.pool.ntp.org
server 1.us.pool.ntp.org
server 2.us.pool.ntp.org
server 3.us.pool.ntp.org
```

Edit `/etc/ntp.conf`, replacing the default servers with the ones identified above.

# Review security configuration.

The default settings are most likely sufficient, but review them against the NTP access restrictions documentation and modify as needed.

# Configure leap seconds.

Download the leap seconds file from http://www.ietf.org/timezones/data/leap-seconds.list and save it to the server in a location like `/var/lib/ntp/leapfile`. Ensure that this file is readable by `ntpd`.

Modify `/etc/ntp.conf` and add the line:

```
leapfile /var/lib/ntp/leapfile
```

See: http://support.ntp.org/bin/view/Support/ConfiguringNTP#Section_6.14.

# Configure logging.

Log output is placed in `/var/log/messages` by default but can be overridden if desired. My preference is to leave it there as it doesnâ€™t really make sense to have a separate log file for a specific service, but the following line in `/etc/ntp.conf` will log elsewhere.

```
logfile /var/log/ntp.log
```

See: https://www.redhat.com/archives/rhl-list/2007-December/msg03702.html

# Start the ntpd service

```sh
service ntpd start
```

# Check synchronization status with peers.

```sh
# ntpq -p

# Sniff UDP port 123.

Watch for NTP packets on UDP 123. It should take a minute or so to see some traffic to the NTP servers.

```sh
# tcpdump dst port 123
