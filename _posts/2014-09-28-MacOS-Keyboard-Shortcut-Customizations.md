Custom keyboard shortcuts that I find useful.

## Maximize Windows

Open System Preferences > Keyboard > Shortcuts > App Shortcuts.

To maximize the currently focused window, add the following.

* Menu Title: Zoom
* Keyboard Shortcut: Control + Option + ⌘ + M

## Tab

It's also useful to be able to tab through the buttons in dialogs (e.g., an OK/Cancel modal dialog). I'm not sure why this is disabled by default in MacOS, but it can be enabled by navigating to System Preferences > Keyboard > Shortcuts and selecting 'All Controls' for the Full Keyboard Access input at the bottom.

## F11, F12, Ctrl + ←, Ctrl + →

Open System Preferences > Keyboard > Shortcuts > Mission Control. Uncheck the following so that these keys can be used in applications:

* Show Desktop (F11)
* Show Dashboard (F12)
* Move left a space (Ctrl + ←)
* Move right a space (Ctrl + →)
