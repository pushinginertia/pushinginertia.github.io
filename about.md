I have been working for the last decade in various professional roles related to my B.Sc. degree in Computer Science. Some of my notable roles have been in network security and systems infrastructure, supply chain system architecture and development, payment system design and implementation, data migration, data architecture, business automation, and systems analysis.

I am Canadian-born and reside in Vancouver. Google my name and you'll find pages of references to about a dozen freeware applications I wrote in the 1990s. Outside of my professional work, you'll find me in a local climbing gym a few times a week or participating in a swing or blues dance at one of Vancouver's weekly venues. I enjoy motorcycling in the warmer part of the year in Vancouver.

On this site, you'll find technical articles on software projects that I develop in my spare time.
